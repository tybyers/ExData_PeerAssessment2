NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

# Assignment: Across the United States, how have emissions from coal 
# combustion-related sources changed from 1999â€“2008?

# Subset SCC by the EI.Sector variable; those rows that include "Coal" --
#  all coal emissions are coal combustion
SCC.coal <- SCC[grep('Coal', SCC$EI.Sector),]

# Now subset NEI data by these SCC numbers
NEI.coal <- subset(NEI, SCC %in% SCC.coal$SCC)

# Here I use the dplyr library to group these emissions from coal by year.
library(dplyr)
year <- group_by(NEI.coal, year)
NEI.coal.by_year <- summarise(year, emissions = sum(Emissions),
